I will now prepare a sketch with all possible moves:
F (Front),  B (Back),  U (Up),  D (Down),  L (Left),  R (Right),  plus the  " ' "  and  " 2 "  variants 

For debugging purpose, moves will be entered through Arduino's serial monitor

According to Singmaster notation,
myCube.L  generates a  <L>  move
myCube.L2  for  <L2> move
myCube.Lp  (L prime) for a  <L'> move


For demonstration purpose, the cube was first mixed according to < D B2 R2 U' F' L F2 R D2 R B2 R' >
In this video, I entered < R B2 R' D2 R' F2 L' F U R2 B2 D' > (inverse moves)  in the IDE Serial Monitor.
